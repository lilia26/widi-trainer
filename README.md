# Scioly WiDi Practice Kit

The Science Olympiad Write It Do It Practice Kit is a web-based tool designed to help team members prepare for the Write It Do It event. In the event, one team member (the "Writer") is given a structure made from construction materials. The writer proceeds to write instructions on how to build the structure. The other team member (the "Doer") then uses the instructions and unassembled materials to try to recreate the structure as accurately as possible. The event depends on the team members to establish common vocabulary to be able to concisely and accurate describe various items under time constraints. Each kit that is included as part of this tool simulates specific aspects of the event experience to enable deliberate practice. The kits are an effective and efficient way for teams to practice and improve their Write It Do It skills.
